# Rapid Development on Kubernetes with Telepresence

## Introduction

Application developers building microservices on Kubernetes quickly encounter two major problems that slow them down.

* Slow feedback loops. Once a code change is made, it must be deployed to Kubernetes to be tested. This requires a container build, push to a container registry, and deployment to Kubernetes. This adds minutes to every code iteration.
* Insufficient memory and CPU locally. Developers attempt to speed up the feedback loop by running Kubernetes locally with minikube or equivalent. However, resource-hungry applications quickly exceed the compute and memory available locally.

This article begins with a brief review of the big-picture continuous development workflows for kubernetes. The focus then shifts to [Telepresence](https://www.getambassador.io/products/telepresence/), a Cloud-Native Computing Foundation project that [addresses these problems](https://www.getambassador.io/use-case/local-kubernetes-development/). Finally, we configure Telepresence step-by-step. The steps should work on any kubernetes setup.


## Continuous Development Workflows - Big Picture

An example workflow to go from code to deployment on kubernetes is as follows.
* Commit code to a dev branch.
* Build container image and associated manifests. This can be triggered manually or through a continuous integration (CI) pipeline.
* Deploy manifests to kubernetes. The tool for this can be push-based (eg. Github Actions) or pull-based (eg. ArgoCD).
* Test/Troubleshoot the new version of application.
* Submit a pull request (PR) to release branch. Repeat. 

That is a lot of steps to test a code change. It is fine for release branch, where the changes are through PR and rest of the process is automated. For developers, the whole process has been simplied for kubernetes. From a big picture standpoint, there are 3 different approaches for continuous deployment. Most users end up picking a mix of these.

### CI/CD for Production
This is almost universal in use. The names of the tools differ. The whole idea is that Git is the source of truth. Processing starts after code is committed to Git. Once container images are built, those are stored in registry. 
![Production CI/CD pipeline](https://imgur.com/vlWprX2.jpg)

Most users tend to use tools that suit them most. Note that some tools (eg. Flux, ArgoCD) are exclusively for kubernetes, whereas most developers have a mixed environment. If you are starting new on kubernetes, it makes sense to use a GitOps operator (eg. ArgoCD) for deployment.

### CI/CD for Development
Imagine if you're working off a development branch, and constantly testing code many times in a day. Waiting for the image to built and run is a waste of development time. What if your laptop becomes the source of truth for the code? Skaffold does the same. 

![Developer CI/CD pipeline](https://imgur.com/O4pfbQO.jpg)

Instead of a CI/CD pipeline running off Git commit, Skaffold allows you to manually or automatically build and deploy modified code to the kubernetes cluster. Moreover, it enables you to troubleshoot the new service without having to use another set of commands. 

Note that you do not want to run skaffold on your production cluster, for the simple reason that the use case is targeted for development.


### Rapid Iteration for Development
With Skaffold, you still had to go through the process of building the image, and uploading to the cluster (and/or registry). Imagine if there was a way to not even upload the new image to the cluster. Instead if you could test the modified code by running the container image on your laptop. Basically your laptop becomes extended part of the cluster.

This works for production and development clusters, and for both local and remote clusters. Telepresence enables this workflow.

The rest of this article will focus on Telepresence, which enables developers to do rapid iteration on kubernetes.

## Telepresence

Telepresence is a Cloud-Native Computing Foundation project for fast efficient development on Kubernetes. With Telepresence, you 1) run your service locally, while you run the rest of your application in the cloud (2, 3).

![Telepresence 2 architecture](https://imgur.com/0wkJiox.jpg)

Telepresence creates a bi-directional network connection between your Kubernetes cluster and local workstation. This way, the service you’re running locally can communicate with services in the cluster, and vice versa.

This approach brings the following benefits:

* Your development environment has infinite scale. Using the cloud, you can have unlimited compute and memory.
* You can use your favorite tools locally. Since your development environment is local, you can use your preferred IDE, debugger, or any other tool that you need.
* You get rapid feedback. There’s no need to do a container build, push to registry, and deployment with every code change.

## Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you will need:

* A Kubernetes cluster such as [Digital Ocean Kubernetes](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/)
* `kubectl` installed locally on a workstation running either Linux or Mac OS X
* A local development environment for Node.js. You can follow [How to Install Node.js and Create a Local Development Environment](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorial_series/how-to-install-node-js-and-create-a-local-development-environment).

Make sure you can perform a `kubectl` operation such as `kubectl get services` before proceeding.

## Step 0 - A Kubernetes Cluster

We will use DigitalOcean Kubernetes for the tutorial. You can substitute this step with your existing kubernetes cluster (local or cloud).

Create a cluster by following the steps using [cloud UI](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/kubernetes/). Note that you will incur some charges towards running the cluster.

## Step 1 — Install Telepresence

We're first going to install Telepresence locally. Telepresence comes as a single binary.

For Mac OS X users:

```command
# 1. Download the latest binary (~60 MB):
sudo curl -fL https://app.getambassador.io/download/tel2/darwin/amd64/latest/telepresence -o /usr/local/bin/telepresence
 
# 2. Make the binary executable:
sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/telepresence
```

If you're on Linux:

```command
# 1. Download the latest binary (~50 MB):
sudo curl -fL https://app.getambassador.io/download/tel2/linux/amd64/latest/telepresence -o /usr/local/bin/telepresence
 
# 2. Make the binary executable:
sudo chmod a+x /usr/local/bin/telepresence
```

## Step 2 - Verify successful installation.

Telepresence connects your local workstation to a remote Kubernetes cluster. We'll test the installation is working correctly. We'll first connect to the cluster:

```command
telepresence connect
```

You'll see the following output:

```
[secondary_label Output]

Launching Telepresence Daemon
...
Connected to context default (https://<cluster public IP>)
```

Now, verify that Telepresence is working properly by connecting to the Kubernetes API server:

```command
curl -ik https://kubernetes
```

You should see the following output:

```
[secondary_label Output]
  HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
  Cache-Control: no-cache, private
  Content-Type: application/json
  Www-Authenticate: Basic realm="kubernetes-master"
  Date: Tue, 09 Feb 2021 23:21:51 GMT
  Content-Length: 165
  {
    "kind": "Status",
    "apiVersion": "v1",
    "metadata": {
    },
    "status": "Failure",
    "message": "Unauthorized",
    "reason": "Unauthorized",
    "code": 401
  }%
```

Congratulations! You're able to use `curl` locally on your workstation to connect to the remote Kubernetes cluster, as if the Kubernetes cluster were running on your laptop.

## Step 3 — Install a Sample Node.js Application

We'll now install a sample NodeJS application to use with Telepresence. This NodeJS application consists of multiple services that communicate with each other.

Start by installing a sample application that consists of multiple services:

```command
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datawire/edgey-corp-nodejs/main/k8s-config/edgey-corp-web-app-no-mapping.yaml
```

```
[secondary_label Output]
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datawire/edgey-corp-nodejs/main/k8s-config/edgey-corp-web-app-no-mapping.yaml

deployment.apps/dataprocessingservice created
service/dataprocessingservice created
```

Give your cluster a few moments to deploy the sample application. Use `kubectl get pods` to check the status of your pods:

```
[secondary_label Output]
$ kubectl get pods

  NAME                                         READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
  verylargedatastore-855c8b8789-z8nhs          1/1     Running   0          78s
  verylargejavaservice-7dfddbc95c-696br        1/1     Running   0          78s
  dataprocessingservice-5f6bfdcf7b-qvd27       1/1     Running   0          79s
```

Once all the pods are in a `Running` state, go to the frontend service in your browser at [http://verylargejavaservice.default.svc.cluster.local:8080](http://verylargejavaservice.default.svc.cluster.local:8080).

You should see the EdgyCorp WebApp with a green title and green pod in the diagram.

## Step 4 - Set up a Local Development Environment

We'll now download the repository containing the services' code and run the NodeJS servicelocally. This version of the code has the UI color set to blue instead of green.

Clone the web app’s GitHub repository:

```command
git clone https://github.com/datawire/edgey-corp-nodejs.git
```

```
[secondary_label Output]
$ git clone https://github.com/datawire/edgey-corp-nodejs.git

  Cloning into 'edgey-corp-nodejs'...
  remote: Enumerating objects: 441, done.
  ...
```

Change into the repo directory, then into DataProcessingService:

```command
cd edgey-corp-nodejs/DataProcessingService/
```

Install the dependencies and start the Node server. 

```command
npm install && npm start
```

```
[secondary_label Output]
$ npm install && npm start

  ...
  Welcome to the DataProcessingService!
  { _: [] }
  Server running on port 3000
```


In a **new terminal window**, `curl` the service running locally to confirm it’s set to strong:

```command
curl localhost:3000/color
```

```
[secondary_label Output]
$ curl localhost:3000/color

  "blue"
```

## Step 5 - Intercept All Traffic to the Service

We’ll now create an intercept. An intercept is a rule that tells Telepresence where to send traffic. In this example, we will send all traffic destined for the `DataProcessingService` to the version of the `DataProcessingService` running locally instead:

Start the intercept with the `intercept` command, setting the service name and port

```command
telepresence intercept dataprocessingservice --port 3000
```

```
[secondary_label Output]
$ telepresence intercept dataprocessingservice --port 3000

  Using deployment dataprocessingservice
  intercepted
      Intercept name: dataprocessingservice
      State         : ACTIVE
      Destination   : 127.0.0.1:3000
      Intercepting  : all TCP connections
```

Go to the frontend service again in your browser. Since the service is now intercepted it can be reached directly by its service name at [http://verylargejavaservice:8080](http://verylargejavaservice:8080). You will now see the blue elements in the app. The frontend’s request to `DataProcessingService` is being intercepted and rerouted to the Node server on your laptop!

## Step 6 - Make a Code Change
We’ve now set up a local development environment for the `DataProcessingService`, and we’ve created an intercept that sends traffic in the cluster to our local environment. We can now combine these two concepts to show how we can quickly make and test changes.

1. Open `edgey-corp-nodejs/DataProcessingService/app.js` in your editor and change line 6 from `blue` to `orange`. Save the file and the Node server will auto reload.

2. Now, visit [http://verylargejavaservice:8080](http://verylargejavaservice:8080) again in your browser. You will now see the orange elements in the application.

We’ve just shown how we can edit code locally, and immediately see these changes in the cluster. Normally, this process would require a container build, push to registry, and deploy. With Telepresence, these changes happen instantly.

## Conclusion

In this article, we walked through a workflow for rapidly developing services on Kubernetes using Telepresence. With Telepresence, you're able to use your favorite development workflow.
